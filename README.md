dupePad
========
As many of you may know, the Frogpad keyboard is dying and the hardware may not be manufactured again. 
In effort to preserve the frogpad layout that many people have devoted much time into learning, I have cloned the frogpad layout for Windows and Mac. 
The frogpad clone uses autohotkey for Microsoft Windows (and can be compiled to a portable .exe file).
And KeyRemap4MacBook for Mac.
========

WINDOWS:
This script uses autohotkey(http://www.autohotkey.com/download/) and can convientely be compiled to a 80kb exe file!
This is very useful because the small file can be stored in email, on a portable usb drive, or on a network drive.
To do this, after autohotkey is installed, right click and "compile to .exe." I would link to this directly, but because of security concers, I encourage you to do this yourself.

MAC:
This uses the helper utility, "KeyRemap4MacBook" (http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/) and is done with custom remaps to the private.xml file.
To do this you must go in to System Preferences > KeyRemap4MacBook > Misc & Uninstall > open private.xml. Once there, use the xml file from this repo for the rest.
